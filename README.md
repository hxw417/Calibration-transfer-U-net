Code for Analytical Chemistry paper ‘A one-dimensional U-net-based calibration transfer method for low-field nuclear magnetic resonance signals’

Abstract: The reconstruction of the statistical analysis model of an instrument is a time-consuming and expensive process. Herein, the feasibility of spectral model calibration transfer application to the same type of low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) instrument was investigated using a one-dimensional U-net (1D U-net).
